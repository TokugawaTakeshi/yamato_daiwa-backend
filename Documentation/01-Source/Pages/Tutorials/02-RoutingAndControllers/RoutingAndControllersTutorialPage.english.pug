    p.Article-Paragraph.

      The separation between #[+Term--YDID URL] (#[+Term--YDID Unified Resource Locator]),
        #[+Term--YDID URN (Unified Resource Name)] and #[+Term--YDID URI (Unified Resource Identifier)] and also
        their decomposition is #[+Keyphrase--YDID could differ depending on information-source].
      Although #[+Term--YDID URL]/#[+Term--YDID URN]/#[+Term--YDID URI] anatomy is the
        #[+Keyphrase--YDID framework independent fundamental pre-required knowledge], we need to agree which
        terminology is actual for #[+ImportantEntity--YDID YDB] framework.

    p.Article-Paragraph.
      First: we will #[+Keyword--YDID not] discuss differences between #[+Term--YDID URL] and #[+ImportantEntity--YDID URL],
        just note that #[+Term--YDID URI] is the #[+Keyword--YDID fullest] entity including both of
        #[+Term--YDID URL] and #[+Term--YDID URN] (#[+Keyphrase--YDID depending on information source],
        #[+Term--YDID URL] and #[+Term--YDID URN] parts could intersect or not).

    p.Article-Paragraph.
      Second, besides the #[+Term--YDID web], the #[+Term--YDID URL]/#[+Term--YDID URN]/#[+Term--YDID URI] is applicable
        to #[+Term--YDID local file system].
      Although it has #[+Keyword--YDID single] conception, here #[+Keyphrase--YDID we are focused on web].
