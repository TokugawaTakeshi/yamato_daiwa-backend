      |
      +Keyphrase--YDID.
        is it #[+Keyword--YDID strongly]&nbsp;advised #[+Keyword--YDID against] of usage of #[+Term--YDID HTTP]
          in production
      | .
      | With the #[+Term--YDID HTTP protocol], the data transferring (including passwords, credit cards
      |   numbers and any other confidential information) is been executed #[+Keyword--YDID without] encryption that
      |   makes this data interceptable by the malware which could&nbsp;not&nbsp;be detected with 100% probability
      |   by any antivirus software.
      | But even you have just a simple website does not work with the personal data, the search engines will
      |   give the smaller ranking to it if you are using the #[+Term--YDID протокол HTTP protocol].

    p.Article-Paragraph.
      The standard solution in the usage of the #[+DefinableTerm--YDID HTTPS protocol] — the #[+Keyword--YDID extension]
        of #[+Term--YDID HTTP] using the #[+ImportantEntity--YDID SSL/TLS] #[+Term--YDID cryptographic protocols]
        for the providing of confidential data exchanging.
      Because #[+Term--YDID HTTPS] is the #[+Keyword--YDID extension] of #[+Term--YDID HTTP], the terms like
        #[+Term--YDID "HTTP request"] are still actual.
      But, to make the #[+ImportantEntity--YDID HTTPS] magic work, first of all, below things must be prepared.

    dl.Article-DescriptionList

      dt Digital Certificate
      dd.
        Large #[+Term--YDID characters sequence] identifying the #[+Term--YDID server] and which is being inspected by
          the browser and other software can submit the #[+Term--YDID HTTP requests] to decide, is it secure to exchange
          by data with this #[+Term--YDID server].

      dt (Private) SLL Key
      dd.
        Large #[+Term--YDID characters sequence] which is being used by #[+Term--YDID server] to establish the
          trusted connection.

    p.Article-Paragraph.
      #[+Keyword--YDID Both] #[+Term--YDID SLL certificate] and #[+Term--YDID SLL key] could be stored on local computer
        or server as files, but ultimately the #[+Term--YDID characters sequences] are being used.

    p.Article-Paragraph.
      #[+Keyphrase--YDID In the production case], #[+Term--YDID the digital certificate] and
        #[+Term__Contrast--YDID private key] #[+Keyword--YDID must] (due to security requirements) be
        #[+Keyword--YDID acquired] #[+Keyword__Contrast--YDID regularly] because of #[+Keyword--YDID limited] validity
        period.
      Usually, it is possible to acquire them from the server providers, with which, most likely, you will deal.
      There are both payed an free #[+Term--YDID certificate/key pairs], but fortunately, in modern times the
        #[+Keyword--YDID payed] ones are required mainly for the sites and applications with stricter than usual
        security requirements (the bank applications, public services sites etc.)

    p.Article-Paragraph.
      #[+Keyphrase--YDID For the local development mode] the #[+Term--YDID certificate] and the #[+Term--YDID key] could
        be issued by #[+Keyword--YDID yourself].
      The issuing process is pretty simple, but it is more difficult to assure the browser that it is fine to trust
        these #[+Term--YDID key/certificate pair].
      Self-issued #[+Term--YDID keys] and #[+Term--YDID certificates] provides #[+Keyword--YDID same] security level
        as acquired ones, but the browsers also accounts where #[+Term--YDID key] and #[+Term--YDID certificate] has
        been issued, and if the trust level is&nbsp;not&nbsp;enough, you will see the message like below one:

    +SingleImageViewer--YDF({
      imageURI: "@AssociatedWithPages/Tutorials/01-HTTPS/Images/ConnectionIsNotPrivateBrowserError.english",
      imageAlternateText:
          "Browser is warns: \"You connection is not private\". " +
          "The cause could the distrust to issued SLL certificate.",
      autoAspectRatioByYDA: true
    })

    p.Article-Paragraph.
      Is is weird to receive such warnings about possible data stealing in relation to the website or web application
        locally developed by us and launched on the the #[+SecondaryEntity__Code--YDID localhost] (not&nbsp;in the
        internet), it&nbsp;not&nbsp;it?
      That is how such security technologies works.
      One of features is, the #[+Term--YDID domain name] is being bound to controllable servers #[+Keyword--YDID set]
        while the #[+ImportantEntity__Code--YDID localhost] does&nbsp;#[+Keyword--YDID not]&nbsp;have such binding
        and could&nbsp;#[+Keyword--YDID not]&nbsp;have, because #[+Keyword--YDID each] local machine has
        #[+Keyword--YDID own] server at #[+ImportantEntity--YDID localhost].
      In addition, the computer could be setup such as the #[+ImportantEntity--YDID localhost] be associated with
        some domain in the internet (hardly you will do such setup, but the malware can).
      As result, the browser could&nbsp;#[+Keyword--YDID not]&nbsp;know what is associated with the
        #[+ImportantEntity--YDID localhost], so it does&nbsp;#[+Keyword--YDID not]&nbsp;trust to is same as to any
        website published in the interned and has the #[+Term--YDID certificate] from doubtful issues.

    p.Article-Paragraph.
      How we can mae the browser to trust the self-issues certificate?
      The easiest way is the #[+ImportantEntity--YDID mkcert], the cross-platform utility.
      Although even it has the limitations (for example, at the moment of #[+SecondaryEntity--YDID Spring 2024]
        the #[+SecondaryEntity--YDID Firefox] browser for #[+SecondaryEntity--YDID Windows] has not being supported),
        generally it can make the majority of popular browsers to trust the self-issues #[+Term--YDID certificates] and
        #[+Term--YDID keys] on most popular #[+Term--YDID Operationing Systems].

      | The #[+ImportantEntity--YDID mkcert] utility does&nbsp;#[+Keyword--YDID not]&nbsp;related with

      |   (#[+ImportantEntity--YDID Chocolatey] for #[+ImportantEntity--YDID Windows],
      |   #[+ImportantEntity--YDID Homebrew] or #[+ImportantEntity--YDID MacPorts] for #[+ImportantEntity--YDID macOS],
      |   and for the #[+ImportantEntity--YDID Linux] it also will be the #[+ImportantEntity--YDID Homebrew], but the

      }).Article-Link official GitHub page of this project
      |   about the actual installation method.

    p.Article-Paragraph.
      Once utility installation done, execute the #[+ImportantEntity__Code--YDID mkcert -install] command.
      It will install the #[+Term--YDID certification authority] which confirms the authenticity of the encryption keys.
      It is #[+Keyword--YDID enough] to execute this #[+Keyword--YDID once]
        #[+Keyphrase--YDID regardless of how many #[+Term--YDID certificates] and #[+Term--YDID keys] you will issue].

    p.Article-Paragraph.
      So, we need the browser trust the #[+Term--YDID certificate] which we will issued for
        #[+SecondaryEntity__Code--YDID https://127.0.0.1] #[+ImportantEntity--YDID URI], and preferably,
        #[+SecondaryEntity__Code--YDID https://localhost].
      Although the #[+SecondaryEntity__Code--YDID localhost] and #[+SecondaryEntity__Code--YDID 127.0.0.1]
        are the same domain, #[+ImportantEntity--YDID mkcert] must introduce each one to browser separately, thus
        both #[+Keyword--YDID must] be specified:

    +CodeViewer--YDF
      +CodeViewer-Listing--YDF({ codeLanguage: CodeViewer__YDF.SupportedCodesLanguages.Bash }).
        mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1

    p.Article-Paragraph.
      You will get the message about #[+SecondaryEntity--YDID localhost.pem] and
        #[+SecondaryEntity--YDID localhost-key.pem] files has been created and also their validity periods:

    +ConsoleOutput--YDF.
      Created a new certificate valid for the following names 📜
        - "localhost"
        - "127.0.0.1"

      The certificate is at "./localhost+1.pem" and the key at "./localhost+1-key.pem" ✅

      It will expire on 18 July 2026

    p.Article-Paragraph.
      It is unclear from the files' names what they contains, is not it?
      That is why we will rename them.
      Actually, we were able to specify the custom names during the inputting of the console command, but during the
        inputting of long command it is easy to make the type mistake, so we will do it using the GUI.
      Now, rename #[+SecondaryEntity--YDID localhost.pem] to #[+SecondaryEntity--YDID SSL_Certificate.pem], and
        #[+SecondaryEntity--YDID localhost-key.pem] to #[+SecondaryEntity--YDID SSL_Key.pem].
      Although with such names is still unclear to which project these #[+Term--YDID certificate] and #[+Term--YDID key]
        related, we will store them only in this project's directory and use only of this project, so we can be
        satisfied with such names.
      Lastly, move these files to #[+SecondaryEntity--YDID SSL] folder of your project.
